# SillyWhale docker images

Welcome on our documentation website.

Here you can find documentation about any [Docker](https://docker.io) image we provide on [store](https://store.docker.com/) and through our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SillyWhale).

For each image, you'll find a section about it. And if it's necessary, we'll create subsections to explain container's content.

According with all we say in [our repository](https://github.com/SillyWhale/_management/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), please be indulgent, we aren't many persons to maintain theses images and this is not our primary work. So, thank for your patience and your kindness.

## About us

We're a small group of friends, we're passionate by IT and all new technologies in this domain.  
We recently worked on [Docker](https://docker.io) containers, and we have a real bad analysis of existing packaged apps. (Not all of them fornunatly)

According to this constatations, we've decided to launch [SillyWhale](https://www.sillywhale.wtf) project to provide our help to persons who aren't be confortable with this tech.

Our goals is some easier to understand :

- Build docker images
- Have a good time working on them
- Not really more

But, we don't want build [Docker](https://docker.io) images and let them in bulk versions on [Docker store](https://store.docker.com/). We've made the choice to fully document any image we build, and we've made the second choice, to secure them at the maximum of our competences.  
Clearly, we don't redevelop applications but only package them, and in this conditions, we couldn't be garant of application's internal security, but we'll make our maximum with all we can configure around.
