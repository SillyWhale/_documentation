# SillyWhale docker images

Welcome on our documentation website.

Here you can find documentation about any [Docker](https://docker.io) image we provide on [store](https://store.docker.com/) and throught our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SillyWhale).

For each image, you'll found a section about it. And if it's necessary, we'll create subsections to explain container's content.

According with all we says in [our repository](https://github.com/SillyWhale/_management/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), please be indulgent, we aren't many persons to maintain theses images and this is not our primary work. So, thank four our patience and your kindness.

## About us

We're little friends group, we're passionate by IT and all news technologies in this domain.  
We some recently work on [Docker](https://docker.io) containers, and we have a so bad analysis of existings packaged apps. (Not all fornunatly)

According to this constatations, we've decided to launch [SillyWhale](https://www.sillywhale.wtf) project to provide our help to persons who aren't be confortable with this tech.

Our goals is some easier to understand :

- Build docker image
- Pass good moments to work on it
- Not realy more

But, we don't want build [Docker](https://docker.io) image and let it in bulk versions on [Docker store](https://store.docker.com/). We have make a choice to full document any image we build, and we've make a second choice, to secure at maximum of us competence these images.  
Surely, we not redevelop applications we package and in this condition, we couldn't be garant to application internal security, but we make our maximum for all we can touch around.
